# About the App:
Our goal for this project is to consume portions of the One Bus Away (OBA) API and create a mobile-first app. One of the biggest shortcomings of the OBA app is the difficulty in searching for stops. The ability to quickly find stops near your current location quickly became a primary feature of our app.

# RESTful API endpoints
| Verb        | Path           | Endpoint  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| GET   | /users        | view all users |
| GET   | /users/:id    | view one user |


# Unsolved Problems
* View bus line on map upon selecting a bus
* Favorite specific busses and/or stops for quick access when signed in

# Future Enhancements
* View bus status (early, on time, late)
* View bus current location with live updates (similar to Uber)
* Set alert when bus is a specific amount of time away from stop
